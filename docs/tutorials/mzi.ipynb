    "## Deconstructing the MZI\n",
    "\n",
    "In an MZI, light entering the circuit is split and travels down two paths of\n",
    "differing lengths. When the light is recombined, it interferes, and the output\n",

    "The grating couplers are the input and output for light in the circuit. The\n",
