In order to understand the concept of residue, it is important that we have a basic understanding of complex integration. Specifically, the integral of the complex logarithm is really useful. Additionally, it is crucial to have a basic understanding of the Larentz series, which can be thought of as a generalization of the Taylor series to complex functions. For a more in depth explanation, I recommend Steve Brunton's videos on these topic. But for the sake of completeness, I will motivate a few of the core concepts here."

This phase has the interesting property that the closed contour integral of $ Log(z) $ about the origin is not zero, but rather some multiple of $ 2\\pi i $.
