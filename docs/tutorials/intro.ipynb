    "Simphony is a Python package for defining and simulating photonic circuits, so having a basic understanding of Python will be helpful. In order to get started you will need to setup a python environment with simphony installed. If you are new to Python, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to manage your Python environment. Once you have Anaconda installed, you can create a new environment and install the [``simphony``](https://pypi.org/project/simphony/) package by running the following commands in your terminal:\n",
