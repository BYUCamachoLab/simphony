    "Simphony is a Python package for that helps in defining and simulating photonic circuits, so having a basic understanding of Python will be helpful. In order to get started you will need to setup a python environment with simphony installed. If you are new to Python, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to manage your Python environment. Once you have Anaconda installed, you can create a new environment and install the [``simphony``](https://pypi.org/project/simphony/) package by running the following commands in your terminal:\n",

    "Our goal with this tutorial is to give some of the background of the basics of simphony and [SAX](https://flaport.github.io/sax/), the underlying scattering parameter solver, in order to simulate a very simple photonic circuit. We'll go through the typical objects found in every circuit definition. We'll also show you how to simulate the circuit and obtain the results.\n",

Models are simply functions that return s-parameters when called with the appropriate arguments. The s-parameter format in SAX is a dictionary of port-to-port scattering parameters. Not only is it easy to select which parameter you want simply using human-readable keys, but it also takes less memory for sparse matrices (those where most port relationships are 0).\n",
