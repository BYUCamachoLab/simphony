==================
SiEPIC Integration
==================

Simphony initially began as an extension to
[SiEPIC-Tools](https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC-Tools), but was officially born
once it became large enough to be considered its own stand-alone project. There
is a repository forked from lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC-Tools, 
[SiEPIC-Tools](https://github.com/sequoiap/SiEPIC-Tools),
that integrates Simphony with SiEPIC-Tools and KLayout in order to perform 
photonic circuit simulations using a layout-driven design methodology.
