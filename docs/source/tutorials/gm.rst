The Green Machine
=================

Code Walkthrough
----------------

This example walks through the file "gm.py". 

It will be completed when I get enough time to do a write-up for it. For now,
reference the available example. The code for this simulation
is still available, though. Note that to be able to use you'll have to install 
SiPANN first.
