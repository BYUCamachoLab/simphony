SiPANN model library
--------------------

A separate Python program exists with a model library built
around Simphony. This program is called SiPANN (Silicon Photonics 
with Artificial Neural Networks). It leverages various machine 
learning techniques to simulate integrated photonic device circuits,
meaning it can very quickly and accurately simulate devices with 
varying parameters (such as waveguide width or thickness) without
having to run a full, slow, FDTD simulation before a designed device
can be used in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design software
such as Simphony.

Installation instructions and documentation, including the available 
model library and its API, can be found in `SiPANN's Documentation`_.
