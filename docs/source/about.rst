About Simphony
==============

This package is still under development. It initially began as an extension to
`SiEPIC-Tools`_, but was broken off into its own independent project as its scope 
grew and it became large enough to be considered its own stand-alone project. 

NOTE: This is still under development; this next paragraph is *almost* true.
There is a repository forked from lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC-Tools, 
[SiEPIC-Tools](https://github.com/sequoiap/SiEPIC-Tools),
that integrates Simphony with SiEPIC-Tools and KLayout in order to perform 
photonic circuit simulations using a layout-driven design methodology.
