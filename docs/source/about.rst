If you aren't familiar already, silicon photonics involves
systems where light is directed using paths on silicon
chips; for communications, computation, or other
applications. The industry is promising: photonics provides
unique capabilities over electronics, and we can fabricate
photonic silicon chips in the same facilities we fabricate
electronic silicon chips already.

As demand for photonics increases, it is important for
designers to have access to software tools for modeling and 
creating these chips. One of Simphony's goals is to offer
these tools, free and open source, so that any developer can use
or extend it.

Another goal of Simphony also simulates these chips faster
than most commercial platforms, using cascading scattering
parameters
