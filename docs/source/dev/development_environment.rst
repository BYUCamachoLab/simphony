Setting up and using your development environment
=================================================

Recommended development setup
-----------------------------

Having compiled code also means that importing NumPy from the development
sources needs some additional steps, which are explained below.  For the rest
of this chapter we assume that you have set up your git repo as described in
:ref:`using-git`.

.. _testing-builds:

Testing builds
--------------

Before submitting any pull requests, however, you should 
ensure that a pip installation of your updated package installs and functions 
properly. To test this, try installing your package locally by removing all 
installed versions of Simphony (by running ```pip3 uninstall simphony``` 
repeatedly until no installations remain) and running the following commands 
(from Simphony's toplevel directory):

```
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
pip3 install dist/simphony-[VERSION].tar.gz
```



.. To build the development version of NumPy and run tests, spawn
.. interactive shells with the Python import paths properly set up etc.,
.. do one of::

..     $ python runtests.py -v
..     $ python runtests.py -v -s random
..     $ python runtests.py -v -t numpy/core/tests/test_nditer.py::test_iter_c_order
..     $ python runtests.py --ipython
..     $ python runtests.py --python somescript.py
..     $ python runtests.py --bench
..     $ python runtests.py -g -m full

.. This builds NumPy first, so the first time it may take a few minutes.  If
.. you specify ``-n``, the tests are run against the version of NumPy (if
.. any) found on current PYTHONPATH.

.. When specifying a target using ``-s``, ``-t``, or ``--python``, additional
.. arguments may be forwarded to the target embedded by ``runtests.py`` by passing
.. the extra arguments after a bare ``--``. For example, to run a test method with
.. the ``--pdb`` flag forwarded to the target, run the following::

..     $ python runtests.py -t numpy/tests/test_scripts.py::test_f2py -- --pdb

.. When using pytest as a target (the default), you can
.. `match test names using python operators`_ by passing the ``-k`` argument to pytest::

..     $ python runtests.py -v -t numpy/core/tests/test_multiarray.py -- -k "MatMul and not vector"

.. .. note::

..     Remember that all tests of NumPy should pass before committing your changes.

.. Using ``runtests.py`` is the recommended approach to running tests.
.. There are also a number of alternatives to it, for example in-place
.. build or installing to a virtualenv. See the FAQ below for details.

.. .. note::

..    Some of the tests in the test suite require a large amount of
..    memory, and are skipped if your system does not have enough.

..    To override the automatic detection of available memory, set the
..    environment variable ``NPY_AVAILABLE_MEM``, for example
..    ``NPY_AVAILABLE_MEM=32GB``, or using pytest ``--available-memory=32GB``
..    target option.


.. Building in-place
.. -----------------

.. For development, you can set up an in-place build so that changes made to
.. ``.py`` files have effect without rebuild. First, run::

..     $ python setup.py build_ext -i

.. This allows you to import the in-place built NumPy *from the repo base
.. directory only*.  If you want the in-place build to be visible outside that
.. base dir, you need to point your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to this
.. directory.  Some IDEs (`Spyder`_ for example) have utilities to manage
.. ``PYTHONPATH``.  On Linux and OSX, you can run the command::

..     $ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD

.. and on Windows::

..     $ set PYTHONPATH=/path/to/numpy

.. Now editing a Python source file in NumPy allows you to immediately
.. test and use your changes (in ``.py`` files), by simply restarting the
.. interpreter.

.. Note that another way to do an inplace build visible outside the repo base dir
.. is with ``python setup.py develop``.  Instead of adjusting ``PYTHONPATH``, this
.. installs a ``.egg-link`` file into your site-packages as well as adjusts the
.. ``easy-install.pth`` there, so its a more permanent (and magical) operation.

.. Other build options
.. -------------------

.. Build options can be discovered by running any of::

..     $ python setup.py --help
..     $ python setup.py --help-commands

.. It's possible to do a parallel build with ``numpy.distutils`` with the ``-j`` option;
.. see :ref:`parallel-builds` for more details.

.. A similar approach to in-place builds and use of ``PYTHONPATH`` but outside the
.. source tree is to use::

..     $ pip install . --prefix /some/owned/folder
..     $ export PYTHONPATH=/some/owned/folder/lib/python3.4/site-packages


.. NumPy uses a series of tests to probe the compiler and libc libraries for
.. funtions. The results are stored in ``_numpyconfig.h`` and ``config.h`` files
.. using ``HAVE_XXX`` definitions. These tests are run during the ``build_src``
.. phase of the ``_multiarray_umath`` module in the ``generate_config_h`` and
.. ``generate_numpyconfig_h`` functions. Since the output of these calls includes
.. many compiler warnings and errors, by default it is run quietly. If you wish
.. to see this output, you can run the ``build_src`` stage verbosely::

..     $ python build build_src -v

.. Using virtualenvs
.. -----------------

.. A frequently asked question is "How do I set up a development version of NumPy
.. in parallel to a released version that I use to do my job/research?".

.. One simple way to achieve this is to install the released version in
.. site-packages, by using a binary installer or pip for example, and set
.. up the development version in a virtualenv.  First install
.. `virtualenv`_ (optionally use `virtualenvwrapper`_), then create your
.. virtualenv (named numpy-dev here) with::

..     $ virtualenv numpy-dev

.. Now, whenever you want to switch to the virtual environment, you can use the
.. command ``source numpy-dev/bin/activate``, and ``deactivate`` to exit from the
.. virtual environment and back to your previous shell.


.. Running tests
.. -------------

.. Besides using ``runtests.py``, there are various ways to run the tests.  Inside
.. the interpreter, tests can be run like this::

..     >>> np.test()  # doctest: +SKIPBLOCK
..     >>> np.test('full')   # Also run tests marked as slow
..     >>> np.test('full', verbose=2)   # Additionally print test name/file

..     An example of a successful test :
..     ``4686 passed, 362 skipped, 9 xfailed, 5 warnings in 213.99 seconds``

.. Or a similar way from the command line::

..     $ python -c "import numpy as np; np.test()"

.. Tests can also be run with ``pytest numpy``, however then the NumPy-specific
.. plugin is not found which causes strange side effects

.. Running individual test files can be useful; it's much faster than running the
.. whole test suite or that of a whole module (example: ``np.random.test()``).
.. This can be done with::

..     $ python path_to_testfile/test_file.py

.. That also takes extra arguments, like ``--pdb`` which drops you into the Python
.. debugger when a test fails or an exception is raised.

.. Running tests with `tox`_ is also supported.  For example, to build NumPy and
.. run the test suite with Python 3.7, use::

..     $ tox -e py37

.. For more extensive information, see :ref:`testing-guidelines`

.. *Note: do not run the tests from the root directory of your numpy git repo without ``runtests.py``,
.. that will result in strange test errors.*


.. Rebuilding & cleaning the workspace
.. -----------------------------------

.. Rebuilding NumPy after making changes to compiled code can be done with the
.. same build command as you used previously - only the changed files will be
.. re-built.  Doing a full build, which sometimes is necessary, requires cleaning
.. the workspace first.  The standard way of doing this is (*note: deletes any
.. uncommitted files!*)::

..     $ git clean -xdf

.. When you want to discard all changes and go back to the last commit in the
.. repo, use one of::

..     $ git checkout .
..     $ git reset --hard


.. Debugging
.. ---------

.. Another frequently asked question is "How do I debug C code inside NumPy?".
.. The easiest way to do this is to first write a Python script that invokes the C
.. code whose execution you want to debug. For instance ``mytest.py``::

..     from numpy import linspace
..     x = np.arange(5)
..     np.empty_like(x)

.. Now, you can run::

..     $ gdb --args python runtests.py -g --python mytest.py

.. And then in the debugger::

..     (gdb) break array_empty_like
..     (gdb) run

.. The execution will now stop at the corresponding C function and you can step
.. through it as usual.  With the Python extensions for gdb installed (often the
.. default on Linux), a number of useful Python-specific commands are available.
.. For example to see where in the Python code you are, use ``py-list``.  For more
.. details, see `DebuggingWithGdb`_.

.. Instead of plain ``gdb`` you can of course use your favourite
.. alternative debugger; run it on the python binary with arguments
.. ``runtests.py -g --python mytest.py``.

.. Building NumPy with a Python built with debug support (on Linux distributions
.. typically packaged as ``python-dbg``) is highly recommended.

.. Understanding the code & getting started
.. ----------------------------------------

.. The best strategy to better understand the code base is to pick something you
.. want to change and start reading the code to figure out how it works. When in
.. doubt, you can ask questions on the mailing list. It is perfectly okay if your
.. pull requests aren't perfect, the community is always happy to help. As a
.. volunteer project, things do sometimes get dropped and it's totally fine to
.. ping us if something has sat without a response for about two to four weeks.

.. So go ahead and pick something that annoys or confuses you about numpy,
.. experiment with the code, hang around for discussions or go through the
.. reference documents to try to fix it. Things will fall in place and soon
.. you'll have a pretty good understanding of the project as a whole. Good Luck!
