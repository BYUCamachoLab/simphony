Development workflow
====================

You already have your own forked copy of the Simphony_ repository, by
following :ref:`forking`, :ref:`set-up-fork`, you have configured git_
by following :ref:`configure-git`, and have linked the upstream
repository as explained in :ref:`linking-to-upstream`.

What is described below is a recommended workflow with Git.

.. _Simphony: https://github.com/BYUCamachoLab/simphony

.. Basic workflow
.. ##############

.. In short:

.. 1. Start a new *feature branch* for each set of edits that you do.
..    See :ref:`below <making-a-new-feature-branch>`.

.. 2. Hack away! See :ref:`below <editing-workflow>`

.. 3. When finished:

..    - *Contributors*: push your feature branch to your own Github repo, and
..      :ref:`create a pull request <asking-for-merging>`.

..    - *Core developers* If you want to push changes without
..      further review, see the notes :ref:`below <pushing-to-main>`.

.. This way of working helps to keep work well organized and the history
.. as clear as possible.

.. .. seealso::

..    There are many online tutorials to help you `learn git`_. For discussions
..    of specific git workflows, see these discussions on `linux git workflow`_,
..    and `ipython git workflow`_.

.. .. _making-a-new-feature-branch:

.. Making a new feature branch
.. ===========================

.. First, fetch new commits from the ``upstream`` repository:

.. ::

..    git fetch upstream

.. Then, create a new branch based on the master branch of the upstream
.. repository::

..    git checkout -b my-new-feature upstream/master


.. .. _editing-workflow:

.. The editing workflow
.. ====================

.. Overview
.. --------

.. ::

..    # hack hack
..    git status # Optional
..    git diff # Optional
..    git add modified_file
..    git commit
..    # push the branch to your own Github repo
..    git push origin my-new-feature

.. In more detail
.. --------------

.. #. Make some changes. When you feel that you've made a complete, working set
..    of related changes, move on to the next steps.

.. #. Optional: Check which files have changed with ``git status`` (see `git
..    status`_).  You'll see a listing like this one::

..      # On branch my-new-feature
..      # Changed but not updated:
..      #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
..      #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
..      #
..      #	modified:   README
..      #
..      # Untracked files:
..      #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
..      #
..      #	INSTALL
..      no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

.. #. Optional: Compare the changes with the previous version using with ``git
..    diff`` (`git diff`_). This brings up a simple text browser interface that
..    highlights the difference between your files and the previous version.

.. #. Add any relevant modified or new files using  ``git add modified_file``
..    (see `git add`_). This puts the files into a staging area, which is a queue
..    of files that will be added to your next commit. Only add files that have
..    related, complete changes. Leave files with unfinished changes for later
..    commits.

.. #. To commit the staged files into the local copy of your repo, do ``git
..    commit``. At this point, a text editor will open up to allow you to write a
..    commit message. Read the :ref:`commit message
..    section<writing-the-commit-message>` to be sure that you are writing a
..    properly formatted and sufficiently detailed commit message. After saving
..    your message and closing the editor, your commit will be saved. For trivial
..    commits, a short commit message can be passed in through the command line
..    using the ``-m`` flag. For example, ``git commit -am "ENH: Some message"``.

..    In some cases, you will see this form of the commit command: ``git commit
..    -a``. The extra ``-a`` flag automatically commits all modified files and
..    removes all deleted files. This can save you some typing of numerous ``git
..    add`` commands; however, it can add unwanted changes to a commit if you're
..    not careful. For more information, see `why the -a flag?`_ - and the
..    helpful use-case description in the `tangled working copy problem`_.

.. #. Push the changes to your forked repo on github_::

..       git push origin my-new-feature

..    For more information, see `git push`_.

.. .. note::

..    Assuming you have followed the instructions in these pages, git will create
..    a default link to your github_ repo called ``origin``.  In git >= 1.7 you
..    can ensure that the link to origin is permanently set by using the
..    ``--set-upstream`` option::

..       git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature

..    From now on git_ will know that ``my-new-feature`` is related to the
..    ``my-new-feature`` branch in your own github_ repo. Subsequent push calls
..    are then simplified to the following::

..       git push

..    You have to use ``--set-upstream`` for each new branch that you create.


.. It may be the case that while you were working on your edits, new commits have
.. been added to ``upstream`` that affect your work. In this case, follow the
.. :ref:`rebasing-on-master` section of this document to apply those changes to
.. your branch.

.. .. _writing-the-commit-message:

.. Writing the commit message
.. --------------------------

.. Commit messages should be clear and follow a few basic rules.  Example::

..    ENH: add functionality X to numpy.<submodule>.

..    The first line of the commit message starts with a capitalized acronym
..    (options listed below) indicating what type of commit this is.  Then a blank
..    line, then more text if needed.  Lines shouldn't be longer than 72
..    characters.  If the commit is related to a ticket, indicate that with
..    "See #3456", "See ticket 3456", "Closes #3456" or similar.

.. Describing the motivation for a change, the nature of a bug for bug fixes or
.. some details on what an enhancement does are also good to include in a commit
.. message.  Messages should be understandable without looking at the code
.. changes.  A commit message like ``MAINT: fixed another one`` is an example of
.. what not to do; the reader has to go look for context elsewhere.

.. Standard acronyms to start the commit message with are::

..    API: an (incompatible) API change
..    BENCH: changes to the benchmark suite
..    BLD: change related to building numpy
..    BUG: bug fix
..    DEP: deprecate something, or remove a deprecated object
..    DEV: development tool or utility
..    DOC: documentation
..    ENH: enhancement
..    MAINT: maintenance commit (refactoring, typos, etc.)
..    REV: revert an earlier commit
..    STY: style fix (whitespace, PEP8)
..    TST: addition or modification of tests
..    REL: related to releasing numpy


.. .. _asking-for-merging:

.. Asking for your changes to be merged with the main repo
.. =======================================================

.. When you feel your work is finished, you can create a pull request (PR). Github
.. has a nice help page that outlines the process for `filing pull requests`_.

.. If your changes involve modifications to the API or addition/modification of a
.. function, you should

.. - send an email to the `NumPy mailing list`_ with a link to your PR along with
..   a description of and a motivation for your changes. This may generate
..   changes and feedback. It might be prudent to start with this step if your
..   change may be controversial.
.. - add a release note to the ``doc/release/upcoming_changes/`` directory,
..   following the instructions and format in the
..   ``doc/release/upcoming_changes/README.rst`` file.

.. .. _rebasing-on-master:

.. Rebasing on master
.. ==================

.. This updates your feature branch with changes from the upstream `NumPy
.. github`_ repo. If you do not absolutely need to do this, try to avoid doing
.. it, except perhaps when you are finished. The first step will be to update
.. the remote repository with new commits from upstream::

..    git fetch upstream

.. Next, you need to update the feature branch::

..    # go to the feature branch
..    git checkout my-new-feature
..    # make a backup in case you mess up
..    git branch tmp my-new-feature
..    # rebase on upstream master branch
..    git rebase upstream/master

.. If you have made changes to files that have changed also upstream,
.. this may generate merge conflicts that you need to resolve. See
.. :ref:`below<recovering-from-mess-up>` for help in this case.

.. Finally, remove the backup branch upon a successful rebase::

..    git branch -D tmp


.. .. note::

..    Rebasing on master is preferred over merging upstream back to your
..    branch. Using ``git merge`` and ``git pull`` is discouraged when
..    working on feature branches.

.. .. _recovering-from-mess-up:

.. Recovering from mess-ups
.. ========================

.. Sometimes, you mess up merges or rebases. Luckily, in Git it is
.. relatively straightforward to recover from such mistakes.

.. If you mess up during a rebase::

..    git rebase --abort

.. If you notice you messed up after the rebase::

..    # reset branch back to the saved point
..    git reset --hard tmp

.. If you forgot to make a backup branch::

..    # look at the reflog of the branch
..    git reflog show my-feature-branch

..    8630830 my-feature-branch@{0}: commit: BUG: io: close file handles immediately
..    278dd2a my-feature-branch@{1}: rebase finished: refs/heads/my-feature-branch onto 11ee694744f2552d
..    26aa21a my-feature-branch@{2}: commit: BUG: lib: make seek_gzip_factory not leak gzip obj
..    ...

..    # reset the branch to where it was before the botched rebase
..    git reset --hard my-feature-branch@{2}

.. If you didn't actually mess up but there are merge conflicts, you need to
.. resolve those.  This can be one of the trickier things to get right.  For a
.. good description of how to do this, see `this article on merging conflicts`_.


.. Additional things you might want to do
.. ######################################

.. .. _rewriting-commit-history:

.. Rewriting commit history
.. ========================

.. .. note::

..    Do this only for your own feature branches.

.. There's an embarrassing typo in a commit you made? Or perhaps the you
.. made several false starts you would like the posterity not to see.

.. This can be done via *interactive rebasing*.

.. Suppose that the commit history looks like this::

..     git log --oneline
..     eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs
..     a815645 Modify it so that it works
..     2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
..     13d7934 First implementation
..     6ad92e5 * masked is now an instance of a new object, MaskedConstant
..     29001ed Add pre-nep for a couple of structured_array_extensions.
..     ...

.. and ``6ad92e5`` is the last commit in the ``master`` branch. Suppose we
.. want to make the following changes:

.. * Rewrite the commit message for ``13d7934`` to something more sensible.
.. * Combine the commits ``2dec1ac``, ``a815645``, ``eadc391`` into a single one.

.. We do as follows::

..     # make a backup of the current state
..     git branch tmp HEAD
..     # interactive rebase
..     git rebase -i 6ad92e5

.. This will open an editor with the following text in it::

..     pick 13d7934 First implementation
..     pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
..     pick a815645 Modify it so that it works
..     pick eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs

..     # Rebase 6ad92e5..eadc391 onto 6ad92e5
..     #
..     # Commands:
..     #  p, pick = use commit
..     #  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
..     #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
..     #  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
..     #  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
..     #
..     # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
..     # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
..     #

.. To achieve what we want, we will make the following changes to it::

..     r 13d7934 First implementation
..     pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
..     f a815645 Modify it so that it works
..     f eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs

.. This means that (i) we want to edit the commit message for
.. ``13d7934``, and (ii) collapse the last three commits into one. Now we
.. save and quit the editor.

.. Git will then immediately bring up an editor for editing the commit
.. message. After revising it, we get the output::

..     [detached HEAD 721fc64] FOO: First implementation
..      2 files changed, 199 insertions(+), 66 deletions(-)
..     [detached HEAD 0f22701] Fix a few bugs + disable
..      1 files changed, 79 insertions(+), 61 deletions(-)
..     Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/my-feature-branch.

.. and the history looks now like this::

..      0f22701 Fix a few bugs + disable
..      721fc64 ENH: Sophisticated feature
..      6ad92e5 * masked is now an instance of a new object, MaskedConstant

.. If it went wrong, recovery is again possible as explained :ref:`above
.. <recovering-from-mess-up>`.

.. Deleting a branch on github_
.. ============================

.. ::

..    git checkout master
..    # delete branch locally
..    git branch -D my-unwanted-branch
..    # delete branch on github
..    git push origin :my-unwanted-branch

.. (Note the colon ``:`` before ``test-branch``.  See also:
.. https://github.com/guides/remove-a-remote-branch


.. Several people sharing a single repository
.. ==========================================

.. If you want to work on some stuff with other people, where you are all
.. committing into the same repository, or even the same branch, then just
.. share it via github_.

.. First fork NumPy into your account, as from :ref:`forking`.

.. Then, go to your forked repository github page, say
.. ``https://github.com/your-user-name/numpy``

.. Click on the 'Admin' button, and add anyone else to the repo as a
.. collaborator:

..    .. image:: pull_button.png

.. Now all those people can do::

..     git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/numpy.git

.. Remember that links starting with ``git@`` use the ssh protocol and are
.. read-write; links starting with ``git://`` are read-only.

.. Your collaborators can then commit directly into that repo with the
.. usual::

..      git commit -am 'ENH - much better code'
..      git push origin my-feature-branch # pushes directly into your repo

.. Exploring your repository
.. =========================

.. To see a graphical representation of the repository branches and
.. commits::

..    gitk --all

.. To see a linear list of commits for this branch::

..    git log

.. You can also look at the `network graph visualizer`_ for your github_
.. repo.

.. Backporting
.. ===========

.. Backporting is the process of copying new feature/fixes committed in
.. `numpy/master`_ back to stable release branches. To do this you make a branch
.. off the branch you are backporting to, cherry pick the commits you want from
.. ``numpy/master``, and then submit a pull request for the branch containing the
.. backport.

.. 1. First, you need to make the branch you will work on. This needs to be
..    based on the older version of NumPy (not master)::

..     # Make a new branch based on numpy/maintenance/1.8.x,
..     # backport-3324 is our new name for the branch.
..     git checkout -b backport-3324 upstream/maintenance/1.8.x

.. 2. Now you need to apply the changes from master to this branch using
..    `git cherry-pick`_::

..     # Update remote
..     git fetch upstream
..     # Check the commit log for commits to cherry pick
..     git log upstream/master
..     # This pull request included commits aa7a047 to c098283 (inclusive)
..     # so you use the .. syntax (for a range of commits), the ^ makes the
..     # range inclusive.
..     git cherry-pick aa7a047^..c098283
..     ...
..     # Fix any conflicts, then if needed:
..     git cherry-pick --continue

.. 3. You might run into some conflicts cherry picking here. These are
..    resolved the same way as merge/rebase conflicts. Except here you can
..    use `git blame`_ to see the difference between master and the
..    backported branch to make sure nothing gets screwed up.

.. 4. Push the new branch to your Github repository::

..     git push -u origin backport-3324

.. 5. Finally make a pull request using Github. Make sure it is against the
..    maintenance branch and not master, Github will usually suggest you
..    make the pull request against master.

.. .. _pushing-to-main:

.. Pushing changes to the main repo
.. ================================

.. *This is only relevant if you have commit rights to the main NumPy repo.*

.. When you have a set of "ready" changes in a feature branch ready for
.. NumPy's ``master`` or ``maintenance`` branches, you can push
.. them to ``upstream`` as follows:

.. 1. First, merge or rebase on the target branch.

..    a) Only a few, unrelated commits then prefer rebasing::

..         git fetch upstream
..         git rebase upstream/master

..       See :ref:`rebasing-on-master`.

..    b) If all of the commits are related, create a merge commit::

..         git fetch upstream
..         git merge --no-ff upstream/master

.. 2. Check that what you are going to push looks sensible::

..         git log -p upstream/master..
..         git log --oneline --graph

.. 3. Push to upstream::

..         git push upstream my-feature-branch:master

.. .. note::

..     It's usually a good idea to use the ``-n`` flag to ``git push`` to check
..     first that you're about to push the changes you want to the place you
..     want.
