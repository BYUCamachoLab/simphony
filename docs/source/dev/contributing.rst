Contributing to Simphony
========================
Simphony is still a growing project, and we appreciate the
work of all current and aspiring volunteers! This page will
describe some of the ways a volunteer can contribute.


Bug Reporting and Feedback
--------------------------
Reporting bugs and giving feedback is one of the most
accessible ways to help the project, and more of this kind
of help is always welcome. If you ever encounter what you
believe to be a bug while using Simphony, or if you identify
an error in the documentation on this site, look to the 
`Github issues`_ for how to report.

The issues page can also be used to suggest features that
you'd like to see added to Simphony. Submit an issue with
the correct tag, and plenty of details on how you envision
the feature, and we may be able to implement it.


Maintaining and Developing
--------------------------
If you'd like to work directly in the code of Simphony--and
you've identified an area in the codebase that needs
updates, improvements, or additions--we'd suggest you create
a fork with your changes and submit a pull request on
Github. The project contributors will review the pull
request as soon as possible, and will work with you to get
it merged. For a detailed walkthrough of the development
process in Simphony, see :doc:`developing`.


Documentation
-------------
If you've identified problems in the documentation here, and
you'd prefer write new documentation or tutorials yourself
rather than submit an issue, we've also provided a
walkthrough on how to build and develop the docs, separately
from the rest of Simphony development. See
:doc:`documenting`.


Also, spread the word about Simphony! All kinds of publicity
are welcome, from social media to blog posts. And finally, 
thank you for your excitement about the project! We are glad
you've found Simphony as a helpful tool, and for your
eagerness to contribute to the project.
