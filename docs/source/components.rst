The bidirectional coupler has 4 ports, labeled as pictured. Its efficiently
splits light that is input from one port into the two outputs on the opposite
side (with a corresponding pi/2 phase shift). Additionally, it efficiently 
interferes lights from two adjacent inputs, efficiently splitting the 
interfered signal between the two ports on the opposing side.

The grating coupler efficiently couples light from a fiber array positioned
above the chip into the circuit. For the TE mode, the angle is -25 degrees 
[needs citation].

The terminator dissipates excess light into free space. If you have a path
where the light doesn't need to be measured but you don't want it reflecting
back into the circuit, you can use a terminator to release it from the circuit.

The y-branch efficiently splits the input between the two outputs.
