## [0.5.0] - 2021-10-20

This update adds a new way to run simulations. Sources and Detectors can be
connected to circuits during a simulation context. When the context ends,
the sources and detectors disconnect from the circuit so it can be used again.

### Added
- Simulation Contexts
- Noise simulations
