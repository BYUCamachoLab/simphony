## [0.3.1] - 2020-05-19

Some developer updates are mainly included in this release, along with a switch
to the GPLv3+ License (from the MIT License).

### Added
- Pre-commit hooks added to assist with code quality.
- Bump2version (pip) now manages version numbering throughout the codebase.

### Changed
- Switched from the MIT License to the GPLv3+.

### Removed
- Some of the source files taken from the SiEPIC-Tools and SiEPIC EBeam PDK 
    packages, which were causing issues with the black codeformatter and were
    unnecessary (as we only use the data files for the compact models anyway).
