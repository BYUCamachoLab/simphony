## [0.3.1] - 2020-05-19

Some developer updates are mainly included in this release, along with a switch
back to the MIT License (from the GPLv3+ License).

### Added
- Pre-commit hooks added to assist with code quality.
- Bump2version (pip) now manages version numbering throughout the codebase.
- [#42](https://github.com/BYUCamachoLab/simphony/pull/42) Added the ability to
    simultaneously sweep over multiple inputs.

### Changed
- Switched back to the MIT License from the GPLv3+.

### Removed
- Some of the source files taken from the SiEPIC-Tools and SiEPIC EBeam PDK 
    packages, which were causing issues with the black codeformatter and were
    unnecessary (as we only use the data files for the compact models anyway).
- The (unimplemented) classes `SinglePortSweepSimulation` and 
    `MultiInputSweepSimulation` were removed in favor of adding single/multi
    input abilities to the base class `SweepSimulation`.
