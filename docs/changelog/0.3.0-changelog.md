## [0.3.0] - 2020-05-18

This version is a complete codebase rewrite implementing a much more
human-friendly way of defining circuits and running simulations. 

Circuits are now defined and stored in a clear, easy-to-understand 
object-oriented way. Integration with other packages should be easy, and the
creation of model libraries or other things that extend the functionality of
Simphony should fit easily into the existing framework.

NOTE: THIS VERSION IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE.

### Added
- [#31](https://github.com/sequoiap/simphony/issues/31) Simphony was placed 
    under continuous integration to ensure code health.
- [#11](https://github.com/BYUCamachoLab/simphony/issues/11) Examples and 
    documentation were created and are hosted online at 
    https://simphonyphotonics.readthedocs.io/
- Nearly the entire SiEPIC EBeam PDK Compact Model Library is available.
- Parser compatible with circuit files exported by SiEPIC-Tools in KLayout
    allows Simphony to perform simulations on files created in KLayout.

### Changed
- Entire package was rewritten from previous versions.

### Removed
- Simphony simulation engine completely rewritten. Former scripts are not 
    compatible with this version and will need to be rewritten.
