## [0.7.0] - 2023-02-20

This is a major version change, and modifies the API and model definitions.

### Added
- 

### Changed
- The base unit is now microns, instead of meters. As this package is directed
    mainly for photonics use cases, the decision was made to move away from
    standard SI units to a more convenient form for those writing simulations
    and implementing models.
- Scattering parameter models and simulations now are typically defined with
    wavelengths instead of frequency, which is more familiar to photonics
    engineers.
- Caching is now handled differently and by the builtin lru_cache functions
    from Python.

### Removed
