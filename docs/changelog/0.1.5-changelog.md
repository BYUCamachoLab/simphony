## [0.1.5] - 2019-06-2 (Scheduled)

### Added
- Waveguide parameters now calculated based off new regression model provided by Easton Potokar.
- [#3](https://github.com/sequoiap/simphony/pull/3): ENHANCEMENT: Add functionality for multi-input simulations

### Changed
- Dependencies are slightly more flexible now, not pinned to a specific version of software.

### Removed
- Dependencies on TensorFlow, Keras, and h5py have been removed since the waveguide model has been replaced.
- Removed the "settings" gui, as it's been migrated over to SiEPIC-Simphony.
- Persistent settings that should only really be in the SiEPIC-Simphony integration package were removed from here and implemented there instead.
