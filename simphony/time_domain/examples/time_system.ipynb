    "Simphony has previously only worked with Linear Time-invariant systems, characterized by S-parameter elements. Time-domain Simphony allows a user to create time-variant components, called time-systems. Simphony provides two types of time systems: `SampleModeSystem` and `BlockModeSystem`. These abstract base classes are to be used in Sample Mode simulations and block mode simulations respectively."

    "# Sample Mode Systems\n",
    "Sample mode simulations are discrete-time simulations where, for each time step, the output of each component is calculated and used to determine the next set of inputs. This approach enables the simulation of circuits containing components whose inputs depend on the unknown outputs of other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for this approach to work, each component must be able to maintain state. During Sample Mode Simulations, Simphony looks for two key methods; `init_state` initializes the state of the system, and `step` takes in the current state of the system and a tuple of inputs (one for each port) and returns the next state of the system and a tuple of outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a custom realization of a `SampleModeSystem` which implements a simple phase shifter. We do not enforce that the state variable is of a particular type, so you may use whatever Python object you wish (as long as it does not create issues with the JIT compilation process)."
