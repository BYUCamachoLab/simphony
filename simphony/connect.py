    connect two n-port networks' s-matrices together.
    specifically, connect port `k` on network `A` to port `l` on network

    function operates on, and returns s-matrices. The function
    :func:`connect` operates on :class:`Network` types.
    Parameters
    -----------
    A : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
            S-parameter matrix of `A`, shape is fxnxn
    k : int
            port index on `A` (port indices start from 0)
