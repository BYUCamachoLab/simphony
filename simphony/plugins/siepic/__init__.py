    Loads a spice file as exported by SiEPIC Tools in KLayout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        The .spi file to be loaded.
    libraries : list of str, optional
        The libraries containing the component models used in the spice file.
        By default, this is the SiEPIC model library.
    
    Returns
    -------
    built : dict
        A dictionary of constructed Python objects, with the following keys:
            - `circuits`: dictionary of circuit names to their corresponding
              instantiated Subcircuit objects.
            - `subcircuits`: instantiated Subcircuit objects for all 
              subcircuits found in the spice data.
            - `analyses`: instantiated Simulation objects for all network
              analyzers found in the spice data.
