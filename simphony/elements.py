        A frequency array, indexed matching the given s_parameters.

    The basic element type describing the model for a component with scattering
    parameters.

    Any class that inherits from Model or its subclasses must declare the
    attributes of an element, see Attributes. Following the general EAFP coding
    style of Python, errors will only be raised when an unimplemented function
    is called, not when the class instance is created.

    Attributes
    ----------
    pins : tuple of str
        A tuple of all the default pin names of the device.
    freq_range : tuple of float
        A tuple of the valid frequency bounds for the element in the order
        (lower, upper). Can be made (-infty, infty) be setting to (None, None).

    Notes
    -----
    If you extended the element with attributes you don't want included
    in an equality comparison, you can add the name of the attribute (as a 
    string) to the base object's `_ignored_` list and it won't be used.

        Regenerates parameters used to generate monte carlo s-matrices.

        If a monte carlo method is not implemented for a given model, this
        method does nothing. However, it can optionally be implemented so that
        parameters are regenerated once per circuit simulation. This ensures
        correlation between all components of the same type that reference 
        this model in a circuit. For example, the effective index of a 
        waveguide should not be different for each waveguide in a small 
        circuit; they will be more or less consistent within a single small
        circuit.

        The MonteCarloSweepSimulation calls this function once per run over
        the circuit.
