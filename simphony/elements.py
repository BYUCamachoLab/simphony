class Model:
    """
    The basic element type describing the model for a component with scattering
    parameters.

    Any class that inherits from Model or its subclasses must declare the
    attributes of an element (see Attributes). Following the general EAFP coding
    style of Python, errors will only be raised when an unimplemented function
    is called, not when the class instance is created.

    Attributes
    ----------
    pins : tuple of str
        A tuple of all the default pin names of the device. Length of default
        tuple should be equal to the number of ports on the device.
    freq_range : tuple of float
        A tuple of the valid frequency bounds for the element in the order
        (lower, upper). Can be made (-infty, infty) be setting to (None, None).

    def s_parameters(self, freq):

        Returns scattering parameters for the element with its given 
        parameters as declared in the optional ``__init__()``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        freq : np.ndarray
            The frequency range to get scattering parameters for.

        Returns
        -------
        s : np.ndarray
            The scattering parameters corresponding to the frequency range.
            Its shape should be (the number of frequency points x ports x ports).
            If the scattering parameters are requested for only a single 
            frequency, for example, and the device has 4 ports, the shape
            returned by ``s_parameters`` would be (1, 4, 4).
        
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            Raised if the subclassing element doesn't implement this function.

        Implements the monte carlo routine for the given Model.

        If no monte carlo routine is defined, the default behavior returns the
        result of a call to ``s_parameters()``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        freq : np.ndarray
            The frequency range to generate monte carlo s-parameters over.

        Returns
        -------
        s : np.ndarray

    def regenerate_monte_carlo_parameters(self):
        """
        Regenerates parameters used to generate monte carlo s-matrices.

        If a monte carlo method is not implemented for a given model, this
        method does nothing. However, it can optionally be implemented so that
        parameters are regenerated once per circuit simulation. This ensures
        correlation between all components of the same type that reference 
        this model in a circuit. For example, the effective index of a 
        waveguide should not be different for each waveguide in a small 
        circuit; they will be more or less consistent within a single small
        circuit.

        The ``MonteCarloSweepSimulation`` calls this function once per run over
        the circuit.

        Notes
        -----
        This function should not accept any parameters, but may act on instance
        or class attributes.
