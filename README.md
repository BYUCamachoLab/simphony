# Simphony
Simulator for Photonic circuits

This package is still under development. It began as an extension to SiEPIC-Tools, but became large enough to become its own stand-alone project. The first minor version is considered what was under develop during its time with SiEPIC-Tools.

Simphony can be installed via pip:

pip install simphony
