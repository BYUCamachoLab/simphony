Simphony, a simulator for photonic circuits, is a fundamental package for designing and simulating photonic integrated circuits with Python.

**Key Features:**

- Free and open-source software provided under the MIT License
- Completely scriptable using Python 3.
- Cross-platform: runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
- Subnetwork growth routines
- A simple, extensible framework for defining photonic component compact models.
- A SPICE-like method for defining photonic circuits.
- Complex simulation capabilities.
- Included model libraries from SiEPIC and SiPANN.

Developed by [CamachoLab](https://camacholab.byu.edu/) at
[Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/).

## Installation

Simphony can be installed via pip using Python 3:

```
python3 -m pip install simphony
```

Please note that Python 2 is not supported. With the official deprecation of
Python 2 (January 1, 2020), no future compatability is planned.

## Documentation

The documentation is hosted [online](https://simphonyphotonics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Changelogs can be found in docs/changelog/. There is a changelog file for
each released version of the software.
